#### Summary

* SNP Heritability is estimated are from LD Score Regression (LDSR; [Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v47/n3/full/ng.3211.html) or [on pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495769/)) using [ldsc](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) and [MTAG](https://github.com/omeed-maghzian/mtag)

* Full code is available on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Nealelab/UKBB_ldsc)

* The [Neale Lab blog](http://www.nealelab.is/blog) has [a full technical discussion](http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/14/heritability-501-ldsr-based-h2-in-ukbb-for-the-technically-minded) on the limitations of this analysis and recommendations for intepreting the results, as well as more general details about [our analysis of UK Biobank](http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/11/details-and-considerations-of-the-uk-biobank-gwas).

* Results on this site are very loosely filtered to report only phenotypes with effective N > 200. Where appropriate, stricter filters are applied as indicated. Results for phenotypes with effective N < 200 can still be found in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g28ee03vy4hvqw5/AADAkDbSFHsYE8bme1Jjeekca/ldsc_results?dl=0" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g28ee03vy4hvqw5/AADAkDbSFHsYE8bme1Jjeekca/ldsc_results?dl=0'); return false;">downloads</a>.

#### LDSR Details

* We follow the conventional approach of restricting to GWAS results from HapMap3 sites passing MAF > 0.01 and INFO > 0.9 as input, but we’ve reimplemented this to define a single passing list in UKBB rather than running `munge_sumstats.py` from [ldsc](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) with the `w_hm3.snplist` reference file.

* We’ve run both univariate and partitioned heritability analyses. For reasons that will be discussed in a later post we’re currently presenting the partitioned heritability LDSR results as the primary analysis in the [summary browser](h2_browser.html), but the univariate results are also available [here](h2_univar_browser.html).

* The univariate LDSR analysis was run with default settings using [precomputed LD scores from 1000 Genomes European ancestry samples](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/) (i.e. `./eur_w_ld`)

* The partitioned LDSR analysis was run using the v1.1 of the Baseline-LD annotations described by [Gazal et al. 2017](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3954.html) (also on [biorxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/03/082024)) computed from 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data from European ancestry populations and corresponding allele frequencies (available from [the ldsc reference downloads page](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/)). Default settings were used, with the exception of removing the maximum $\chi^2$ filter due to the extreme sample size of UKBB.

#### Tools

* LDSR was run using the implementation in [MTAG](https://github.com/omeed-maghzian/mtag), which provides a convenient interface to [ldsc](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) from within python rather than via the command line.

* All analyses were run on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), with the assistance of [Hail](https://hail.is), [cloudtools](https://github.com/Nealelab/cloudtools), and many other tools. 

* This site has been generated with the assistance of [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/), [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/), and is hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
