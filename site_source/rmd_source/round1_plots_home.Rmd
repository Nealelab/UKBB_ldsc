### Overview

To assist with exploring results for >2,000 traits, we've developed a set of interactive plots 

* [$h^2$ and intercept estimates](round1_viz_h2.html)
* [Partitioned annotation effect sizes](round1_viz_annot.html)
* [QQ plots of $h^2$ and intercept significance](round1_viz_qq.html)
* [Relationship of estimates with sample size](round1_viz_sampsize.html)
* [Comparison of univariate and partitioned LDSR](round1_viz_univar.html)
