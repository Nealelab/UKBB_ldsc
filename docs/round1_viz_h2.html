<p><strong>Note:</strong> The “ratio” metric from LDSR is defined as: <span class="math display">\[\frac{Intercept-1}{mean(\chi^2)-1}\]</span> and is roughly an estimate of the balance between inflation in <span class="math inline">\(lambda_{GC}\)</span> (i.e. the genomic control factor) due to confounding vs. inflation from polygenic signal. Phenotypes with <span class="math inline">\(mean(\chi^2) &lt; 1.002\)</span> are excluded. This value will be inflated if the LDSR intercept is inflated, for instance due to model misspecification.</p>
