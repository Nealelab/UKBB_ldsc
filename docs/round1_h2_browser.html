<h3 id="lookup-a-phenotype">Lookup a phenotype</h3>
<p>Explore results of partitioned LD score regression for UK Biobank phenotypes. You can read more about this analysis and find links to more information <a href="http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/15/heritability-of-2000-traits-and-disorders-in-the-uk-biobank">on the annoucement page</a>.</p>
<p>You can search for phenotypes by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>, e.g. “height”</li>
<li><strong>ICD code</strong>, e.g. “I25”</li>
<li><strong>ID</strong>, i.e. the UK Biobank phenotype ID matching the <a href="http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/search.cgi">UK Biobank showcase</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Results shown here include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>N</strong>: The sample size in the UK Biobank analysis set (more info on the GWAS analysis <a href="http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/11/details-and-considerations-of-the-uk-biobank-gwas">here</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence</strong> (Prev.) for binary phenotypes</li>
<li><strong>Intercept</strong> (Int.): the intercept term from partitioned LD score regression. Values &gt; 1 may indicate population stratification, confounding, or some other model misspecification. P-value (Int. p) corresponds to the test that the intercept is greater than 1.</li>
<li><strong>Heritability</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(h^2\)</span>): the SNP heritability estimate from partitioned LD score regression. Value is given on the liability scale for binary phenotypes, assuming that the population prevalence matches the prevalence in the UK Biobank analysis set. P-value (h2 p) corresponds to the test that the intercept is greater than 1.</li>
