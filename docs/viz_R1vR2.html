<h3>Overview</h3>
<div class="well">
<p>Comparison of our current primary results from partitioned LDSR of the <a href="http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank">Round 2 Neale Lab GWAS</a> to previous results from paritioned LDSR of <a href="http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/7/19/rapid-gwas-of-thousands-of-phenotypes-for-337000-samples-in-the-uk-biobank">Round 1 GWAS</a>. Both results use the Baseline LD v1.1 model. The Round 2 GWAS results use a slightly broader sample set than ‘white British’ and incorporate additional covariates (<a href="https://github.com/Nealelab/UK_Biobank_GWAS">more detail on github</a>).</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="intercept" class="section level3 tabset tabset-fade">
<h3>Intercept</h3>
<p>Since the sample sizes are different, we focus here on comparison of the ratio. Smaller ratios in the current results from Round 2 GWAS suggest reduced confounding, likely due to the expanded set of covariates. P-values for the intercept estimates are similarly less significant in the Round 2 results.</p>

<h3>SNP Heritability</h3>
<p>SNP heritability results are highly concordant between Round 1 and Round 2. SNP heritability is increased for a handful of phenotypes where the updated GWAS covariates are likely to have strong effects. P-values for the Round 2 SNP heritability results are slightly stronger in the increased sample size.</p>

<h3>Precision</h3>
<p>We can compare the standard errors (SEs) of the estimates between Round 1 and Round 2 to evaulate how much precision was gained from the expanded sample size in Round 2. We observe generally smaller SEs for the SNP heritability and slightly increased SEs for the intercept.</p>
