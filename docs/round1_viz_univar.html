<p>Comparison of our primary <span class="math inline">\(h^2\)</span> results from partitioned LDSR to results from univariate LDSR with default settings. These differ in two key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference panel:</strong> Univariate 1000 Genomes European LD scores (i.e. precomputed <code>./eur_w_ld</code>) vs. BaselineLD v1.1 LD scores from 1000 Genomes Europeans, as described in <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3954.html">Gazal et al. 2017</a> (also on <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/03/082024">biorxiv</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Max chi^2 filtering:</strong> Default settings with “two-step” estimation (limiting intercept estimation to regression with <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2 &lt; 30\)</span> before estimating <span class="math inline">\(h^2\)</span> in regression with the intercept fixed to the first stage estimate) vs. one-step estimation with no <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> filter</li>
