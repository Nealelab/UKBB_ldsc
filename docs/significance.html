<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Having established a <a href="confidence.html">list of phenotypes where we have reasonable confidence</a> in the LDSR results, we can now address the question of which phenotypes are significantly heritable. The primary question is how to account for multiple testing across the GWASed phenotypes.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Expected quantiles are computed within each confidence bin.</p>
<p>Weaker p-values among the lower confidence phenotypes are not surprising given that most phenotypes in those bins have reduced confidence due to smaller sample sizes. This is especially true for the phenotypes designated as “medium” confidence due to potential sex biases or nonlinear ordinal codings, where the potential biases are unlikely to completely remove true signal from their GWAS. Conversely, it is not surprising that there are non-significant results among the high confidence phenotypes since the confidence level is not assigned based on the <span class="math inline">\(h^2_g\)</span> estimate, only based on expectations about the stability and potential biases in that estimate.</p>

<h1>Multiple testing correction</h1>
<p>Given the large number of phenotypes, it’s important to account for multiple testing in defining significance for the <span class="math inline">\(h^2_g\)</span> estimates. Although we might be comfortable with a conventional Bonferroni correction for significance, this is complicated by two considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we test low confidence results? (i.e. should phenotypes denoted as low confidence count towards the number of tests to be corrected for in the Bonferroni adjustment)</li>
<li>How should we address correlation between the phenotypes? We know many of the UK Bioank phenotypes are strongly correlated, and the Bonferroni significance threshold will be very conservative if we treat the test of those phenotypes as independent.</li>
</ul>

<div id="estimating-the-effective-number-of-independent-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Estimating the effective number of independent tests</h2>
<div class="well">
<p>Focusing on the question of <em>independent</em> tests, we can adopt the method of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3059433/">Li et al. 2011</a> to estimate the number of effectively independent phenotypes (<span class="math inline">\(M_{eff}\)</span>) based on the observed correlation between the phenotypes. Specifically, we compute <span class="math inline">\(M_{eff} = M - \sum I(\lambda_i &gt; 1)(\lambda_i-1)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i\)</span> are the eigenvalues of the phenotypic correlation matrix. Thus asymptotically <span class="math inline">\(M_{eff}=M\)</span> when the phenotypes are independent (i.e. all <span class="math inline">\(lambda_i=1\)</span>) and shrinks proportional to the amount of redundancy from correlation between phenotypes.</p>
<p>We estimate these phenotypic correlations from the UK Biobank GWAS sample (minus a handful of individuals who have withdrawn since the Round 2 GWAS release) after residualizing on the GWAS covariates (<span class="math inline">\(sex, age, age^2, sex \times age, sex \times age^2, 20 PCs\)</span>) using pairwise complete data. This leaves some phenotypic correlations that either cannot be estimated due to never being measured in the same individual (e.g. sex-specific items across sex, or other conditional dependencies on previous items), or where the correlation estimate is highly unstable due to the number of intersecting individuals observed for both phenotypes is small. To resolve this, we conversatively set to zero all correlations between pairs of phenotypes where less than 1000 individuals are observed for both phenotypes.</p>
<p>This computation of <span class="math inline">\(M_{eff}\)</span> suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>488.7 tests among high confidence phenotypes alone</li>
<li>725.43 tests among medium and high confidence phenotypes combined</li>
<li>1183.62 tests among low, medium, and high confidence phenotypes combined</li>
</ul>
<p>We skip computation of <span class="math inline">\(M_{eff}\)</span> including phenotypes with no confidence since we generally don’t recommend use of those results.</p>

<h2>Potential thresholds</h2>
<div class="well">
<p>The above process leaves us with a large number of possible p-value thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;.05\)</span> for nominal significance</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;1.02\times 10^{-4}\)</span> for the 488.7 effective tests in high confidence phenotypes</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;6.21\times 10^{-5}\)</span> for the 805 high confidence phenotypes, treating them as independent</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;6.89\times 10^{-5}\)</span> for the 725.43 effective tests in medium and high confidence phenotypes</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;4.25\times 10^{-5}\)</span> for the 1177 medium and high confidence phenotypes, treating them as independent</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;4.22\times 10^{-5}\)</span> for the 1183.62 effective tests in low, medium and high confidence phenotypes</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;2.66\times 10^{-5}\)</span> for the 1880 low, medium, and high confidence phenotypes, treating them as independent</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p&lt;1.2\times 10^{-5}\)</span> for the 4178 GWASed phenotypes (including those with no confidence for <code>ldsc</code>), treating them as independent</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 3.167 \times 10^{-5}\ (z &gt; 4)\)</span> as previously suggested as a rule of thumb for the necessary level of <span class="math inline">\(h^2_g\)</span> signal necessary to support subsequent LDSR analyses of genetic correlation (<span class="math inline">\(r_g\)</span>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26414676">Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015</a>)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 1.280 \times 10^{-12}\ (z &gt; 7)\)</span> as previously suggested as a threshold for inclusion in stratified LDSR analyses (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626285/">Finucane et al. 2015</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We observe that the differences between most of these options based on (effective) number of tests is fairly marginal. Splitting the phenotypes by confidence level, we see the number of phenotypes surpassing each p-value threshold is quite similar.</p>

<p>We anticipate that these should cover most of the range of interests in using and interpreting the LDSR <span class="math inline">\(h^2_g\)</span> results. we adopt <span class="math inline">\(z &gt; 4\)</span> as the primary significance threshold, since it conservatively approximates the Bonferroni thresholds of interest (among medium and high confidence phenotypes) and matches the previously suggested standard for recommending followup analyses. This conservative choice does mean that a few phenotypes that would reach significance under one of the other thresholds are omitted, but p-values and results for all phenotypes are reported so other thresholds can be applied by other researchers if desired.</p>
